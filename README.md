Crash-Landing-HQM-Pack Beta
======================

Note:This beta includes both the quick fixes so you only need to create a new instance with the files.

OK everyone, here it is at last Beta 2. 
I wanted to have a finished Beta at this time, but due to the amount of work that was needed and a few unforeseen problems I wasn’t able to finish it.
There are a few things I know I need to do, but instead of waiting even longer to release I want to go ahead and let you all try to break what I’ve gotten done so far, while I finish up. The big things I need to know about:

1. Are the city spawn rates good? I want you to have to look for them, but not have it be impossible to find them.

2.Same with the lone buildings: is there anything major wrong with the buildings, mob rate, and of course any problems with the quest.

Some things are still a WIP and as such there are almost certainly bugs and other unintended problems. Back up your saves BEFORE using the beta. I am not responsible for lost progress if you do not.

Any problems with the beta can be reported on the forums.
